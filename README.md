# Run? :light_rail:  :bus:  :train2:  :running:

This is going to be a simple web app to help me **commute more efficiently** (and maybe you, if I get round to it).

This is *not* a transport planning app.  
(Citymapper's pretty good at that already.)

Instead, this is for someone who knows *exactly* where they're going, but **doesn't want to miss their connection**.

1. You see all the live departures on your commuting route at a glance.  
2. You work out if you need to run or not.
3. You proceed at your chosen pace.

Simple as that :smile:

### Uses Node v6.9.1

#### I'm keeping track of any problems or bugs encountered [here](https://github.com/minaorangina/run/blob/master/problems-solutions.md)
